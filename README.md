# TrainSchedule
This app allows users to add a train with some information such as its name, destination, when the first train departs and how 
frequently it leaves.

The program takes that information and stores it in a firebase database which then is used to update the main page.

The program will also calculate the next arrival of the train based on what information was inputted. 

Lastly, if users want to remove the data from the database (and the site) they can click on the "x" on the right side which will remove it
